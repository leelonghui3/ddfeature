  <!-- Story -->
  <div class="uk-container uk-container-center uk-margin-large-top">
    <article class="uk-article">

      <p class="uk-article-lead">When Giannis Antetokounmpo joined the NBA in 2013, everyone can’t help but focus on his name. The Greece national has a unique name, which is pronounced as yahn-is anh-teh-toe-kuhn-po, and the name earned him the nickname “The Greek Alphabet”.</p>

      <p>In his rookie year, the Milwaukee Bucks’ small forward was averaging 6.8 points, 4.4 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game. But it has been a different story since then. In the current 2017-18 season, Antetokounmpo’s performance had sky-rocketed to
        29.5 points, 10.4 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game. </p>

      <p>The six-foot-11 and 222-pounder dominates the games with his all-rounded skills (except his three-point shooting). He is the second top scorer in the league and one of the fiercest most valuable player (MVP) award contenders for this season at the
        age of 23.</p>

      <p>Antetokounmpo is another success story of the non-US players in the top basketball league of the world, but he was not the first.</p>

      <p>NBA has become an international league with over 100 non-US players playing top level basketball every night on the court. But how good the non-US players are? Yearly numbers show that the non-US players are getting more significant in the NBA.</p>

      <p>This article uses three statistical categories - points, rebounds and assists - to measure the players’ performance as they are the fundamental values to determine the efficiency of the players.</p>

      <p>Players who have dual citizenship, such as Boston Celtics’ guard Kyrie Irving who had represented US national basketball team, were not categorised as a non-US player in this article.</p>

      <h2>Contributions are proportional to number of players</h2>

      <p>NBA statistics show that the non-US players were getting more points, rebounds and assists since the 2000-01 season to the 2016-17 season. As the number of non-US players increases, these court contributions increase proportionately.</p>

      <p>Back in the 2000-2001 season, the total points, rebounds and assists accumulated by all 435 players of 29 teams in were 225,456, 100,987 and 51,787 respectively. The total 36 non-US players only contributed 6.47% of points, 8.26% rebounds and 4.94%
        assists.</p>

      <p>In the 2016-2017 season, the number of non-US players had jumped to the highest record at 114 - approximately a quarter of the total 450 players of 30 teams.</p>

      <p>The non-US players then contributed more than 20% shares in points, rebounds and assists in last season.</p>

      <p>In the late 80s, NBA teams started looking for talents outside the US soil, but it did not become a trend until when people saw what Pau Gasol from Spain could deliver immediately after entering the league in 2001.</p>

      <p>The seven-foot centre was playing for Memphis Grizzlies in his rookie year, and he immediately showed his talent by scoring 17.6 points, grabbing 8.9 rebounds and blocked 2.1 shots per game. His performance had won him the Rookie of the Year award
        and two NBA championships later in 2009 and 2010 when he was playing for Los Angeles Lakers.</p>

      <p>Spanish national basketball team also had emerged as a strong team internationally with Gasol, who had helped his country to win many gold and silver medals in international competitions.</p>

      <p>Another driving factor for the teams to recruit more non-US players was presumably the time when German power forward Dirk Nowitzki had a breakthrough season in 2000-01. He scored more than 20 points per game with his signature fadeaway jump shot
        and led Dallas Mavericks to become one of best teams in the NBA for the next decade.</p>

      <h2>Other countries is catching up the US</h2>

      <p>The US basketball team has been formed by NBA players since the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games and it remained undefeated for the next ten consecutive years in all international competitions.</p>

      <p>However, it suffered the first loss in the 2002 FIBA World Championship, only managed to get the sixth place in the tournament. It had then faced a setback again in the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, only winning a bronze medal.</p>

      <p>Although the US was able to regain its top spot four years later in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, it showed that the US players are not the only one who can play world-class basketball.</p>

      <p>The US lost to Argentina in both the 2002 FIBA World Championship and 2004 Athens Olympic Games.</p>

      <p>The Argentinian team was led by its top players Manu Ginobili, whose career flourished in both NBA and internationally. He joined the San Antonio Spurs team in 2002 and helped the team to win four NBA championships. He also led his national team
        to win gold medal in the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. Ginobili is 40 years old now, and he is still playing in the NBA, making him the second oldest veteran player in the league.</p>

      <p>As a result, many NBA teams were scouting for the next top non-US players like Gasol, Nowitzki or Ginobili.</p>

      <h2>Europe is the main talent pool</h2>

      <p>Among others, Europe is one of the main talent pools for NBA teams due to its matured system of basketball leagues and training programme.</p>

      <p>For the past 17 seasons, more than half of the 270 non-US players are from Europe.</p>

      <p>This includes Italian player Andrea Bargnani, who was the first European player to be drafted first overall in 2006, and Pau Gasol’s younger brother Marc who joined the league in 2008.</p>

      <p>Europe may have produced many NBA players as a continent since year 2000, but it was Canada that has the most NBA players as a single country in the same period with 20 of them.</p>

      <p>The boom in talented Canadian players in the NBA over the last 17 years can be attributed to several reasons. The country used to have two NBA teams in Vancouver and Toronto respectively which inspired many youngsters to play basketball over the
        country’s most popular sport - ice hockey.</p>

      <p>The Vancouver Grizzlies left for Memphis, US, in 2001 while the Toronto Raptors still remains.</p>

      <p>One of the greatest Canadian basketball players, Steve Nash, a retired NBA guard who won two MVP titles consecutively, was well-known for his incredible passing and deathly three-point shooting skill.</p>

      <p>The undergoing 2017-18 NBA season sees 109 non-US players from 42 countries playing in the league. Toronto Raptors has the most non-US players with seven, followed by Utah Jazz, San Antonio Spurs, Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics with six respectively.</p>

      <h2>Non-US players do not guarantee championship</h2>

      <p>However, judging from the record of the past 17 seasons, having more non-US players does not necessarily mean better chance to win the NBA championship.</p>

      <p>Most of the teams that won the previous championships have four or less non-US players on their rosters. Some champions, like the 2006 Miami Heat and the 2008 Boston Celtics not even have a single non-US player.</p>

      <p>The San Antonio Spurs is the only team that have success stories to tell with its internationally diverse roster. The team had seven, five and eight non-US players in its roster respectively when it won the championship in 2005, 2007 and 2014.</p>

      <p>In fact, the mediocre non-US players still outnumber those who are performing above average. Native US players are dominating the league with their outstanding performance. It is reflected by the US players leading most of the categories on statistic
        sheet.
      </p>

      <p>This lead to a more prominent question for the NBA teams, does having more non-US players a guarantee to success?</p>

      <p>Although the non-US players began their influx into the league years ago, unfortunately not all players are performing at the level that meets the teams’ expectations. Some team had made wrong decisions in picking international players.</p>

      <p>Most of these players have quit while some of them remain in the league, but not as the players that they were expected to be in the first place. Instead, they probably have become bench players who hardly earn the trust of coaches.</p>

      <p>Darko Milicic from Serbia is one of the examples. Detroit Piston had chosen Milicic in the 2003 draft with its second overall pick. It has become a laughing stock for many years as the team overlooked better players like Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade.</p>

      <p>Milicic left NBA in 2012 and became a kickboxer. During his nine-year career, he only averaged 6 points and 4.2 rebounds per game despite being a top pick.</p>
